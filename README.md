# Kotlin Compose Desktop vs Flutter Desktop

This is a small person project to practise and (kind of) benchmark the two solutions to multiplatform development. This was just a fun little experiement for me to do on a Saturday afternoon.

## Kotlin Compose Code

The infinite list handler code can be found [here](https://dev.to/luismierez/infinite-lazycolumn-in-jetpack-compose-44a4)
The Retrofit code was based on [this](https://dev.to/theimpulson/making-get-requests-with-retrofit2-on-android-using-kotlin-4e4c)

## Flutter Code

The infinite list was entirely based on [this](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterinfinitelisttutorial)

## Benchmark

### Primes:

Kotlin: average of 3276ms

Flutter: average of 3657ms
